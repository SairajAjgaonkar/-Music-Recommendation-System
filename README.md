# üéµ Music Recommendation System

---

## üîç Project Overview
This project is a **Music Recommendation System** that suggests songs to users based on their favorite singers and preferences. It uses **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** techniques, combined with a simple web app deployed using **Streamlit**.

---

## üìÇ Dataset
- **File Used:** `gaanasongs.csv`
- **Columns:**
  - `name` (Song Name)
  - `singer` (Singer Name)
  - `singer_id` (Singer Unique ID)
  - `duration` (Duration of Song)
  - `link` (URL Link to Song)
  - `language` (Language of Song)

---

## üë• Approach
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert user interaction into numerical ratings if needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Find top singers.
   - Explore language distribution.

3. **Model Building:**
   - Collaborative Filtering for recommending based on user preferences.
   - Content-Based Filtering for recommending songs with similar features.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Build a Streamlit app for interactive recommendations.
